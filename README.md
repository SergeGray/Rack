This rack application was designed to return current time in a requested format.

The format is supplied in a 'format' http parameter and takes a form of any of the words
'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'minute', 'second' in any order. It then returns the current time
formatted in that order in the body of an http response.

This was a learning project for an online Ruby course Thinknetica. https://thinknetica.com/
